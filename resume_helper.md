# How to use this Doc

This is designed to be a template you can use to help you easily customize your resume for a particular job requirement.

You can cut content from a text box

```
this is a text box
```

and fill it out with your own information, and then paste it into any LLM of your choosing.

This workflow is designed to go from top to bottom.  When you encounter the text **ENTER** this means you should press that button to send the content you pasted to the AI.

## Step 1: Tell AI how to act, and about yourself

You will need to tell the AI what it will be doing, so we give it a persona, and also give it the big resume we drafted using the Broda courseware.

```
You are a career coach with years of experience helping clients customize resumes based on job descriptions.  You are really good at identifying the key skills and experiences that are listed in a job description and helping your clients highlight those in their resumes.

"""

This is my resume, sound good so far?

```

**ENTER (**you can ignore the response from the AI, for now)

## Step 2: Add Context about the Job You are Applying for

Tell AI about the job, and the important characteristics you want it to concentrate on.

```
I am going to be applying for a role with the following Job Description:

"""
